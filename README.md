# Rope-Simulation
Following a small tutorial from Sebastian Lague on a rope simulation.

The physics does not use Unity's physics engine, instead all hinges (circles) have gravity pulling them down, and then she sticks hold them together while staying at their given length.

You can find Sebastian's video at https://youtu.be/PGk0rnyTa1U, it contains a whole lot more than just rope simulation!
